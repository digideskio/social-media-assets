# Social Media Assets

A simple table that lists:

* Icon
* Name
* Colors (hex, rgb, hsl)
* Logo and various assets URLs
* Brand guidelines URLs

of popular media and social media websites.

## Current websites

* Twitter
* Facebook
* Google+
* GitHub
* Pinterest
* Tumblr
* YouTube
* Dribbble
* Flickr

## Future websites

* Hacker News
* Reddit
* Stumble Upon
* App.net
* Designer News

## Contribution

Add an issue if you:

* want another website to be listed
* want additional info to be included
* see that a color or link is deprecated
* have a suggestion on how to improve the page

## To-do

* Better responsiveness
* Try to automate the code with a script (it's currently done solely by hand)
* Checkbox to include/exclude the `#`, `rgb()`, and `hsl()` from the field
* Better tab-index (in order to cycle through hex codes only, for example)

## To-not-do

Things I *don't* want to implement:

* Copy to clipboard (right now, the JS only selects all the field when clicking it)
* CMYK or EPS
* Secondary colors
* Target blank
